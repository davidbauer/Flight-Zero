    <p><b>How does this work?</b> Based on the number of flights you enter, the application calculates total emissions in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents, assuming an average of <span class="co2perhourshort"></span>kg of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents per hour flown. Please be aware that quite a few assumptions and simplifications go into these calculations. My goal is to provide you with an easy way to get a rough estimate of all the carbon emissions your flight activity in the past has caused, and the cost of offsetting these emissions. The resulting numbers will not be correct down to the last digit, but you can expect them to be in the right ballpark. If in doubt, just round up.</p>
    
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/davidbauer/Flight-Zero/blob/main/script.js">source code of this application</a> is open so you can see all the assumptions I'm basing my calculations on. If you have ideas on how to improve them while keeping things simple, <a href="mailto:hello@davidbauer.ch ">let me know</a>.</p>
      
    <p>If you have the time, and remember all flights you've taken in the past, you can use a service like <a href="https://co2.myclimate.org/en/flight_calculators/new">MyClimate</a> or <a href="https://www.atmosfair.de/en/offset/flight/">Atmosfair</a> to calculate emissions more precisely.</p>
	
	<p><b>Why offset?</b> Flying is one of the main ways in which individuals contribute to the climate crisis. While it's best to reduce emissions in the first place, offsetting provides a way to compensate emissions that have already occurred, either by investing in technology that removes carbon from the air, or by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere.</p> 
			
	<p><b>Wait, but isn't carbon offsetting bad?</b> That depends on you. It's bad if you just use it to feel better while you continue causing too many emissions. However, it's a good way to deal with emissions you've already caused and can't undo. It's good if it is one of many actions you take and part of a commitment to being more considerate going forward.</p>
	
	<p><b>Wait, but is it effective?</b> According to <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/recommendations">Giving Green</a>, a non-profit that researches the most effective ways to donate to fight the climate crisis, carbon offsets and removals are second only to efforts to influence policy change. So you could also donate the amount calculated above ($<span class="totalCost">___</span>) to organisations that fight for climate policy change.</p>
		
	<p><b>But will my tiny contribution make a difference?</b> I like to look at it this way: Everything you do, tiny as it might be, can inspire others to follow suit. Over time, these effects compound. At the same time, you're perfectly right: Real change happens when informed consumers and citizens demand action from corporations and elected officials. Solving the climate crisis isn't either/or. Let's do all we can.</p>
